    "### Panel VAR Analysis – RQ1\n",
    "To examine whether support for climate policies shifts during elections and whether such support exhibits dynamic interdependence over time, I estimated a Panel Vector Autoregression (Panel VAR) model with one lag (VAR(1)) using two variables: support for carbon taxes (`cc_pol_tax`) and support for emissions standards for car manufacturers (`cc_pol_car`). The analysis was conducted using data from 861 individuals observed across three waves, resulting in 2,583 panel observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Panel VAR(1) model includes two equations:\n",
    "1. **Support for carbon taxes at time t (`cc_pol_tax_t`)** regressed on:\n",
    "   - Support for carbon taxes at time t–1 (`cc_pol_tax_lag`)\n",
    "   - Support for emissions standards at time t–1 (`cc_pol_car_lag`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Support for car emissions standards at time t (`cc_pol_car_t`)** regressed on:\n",
    "   - Support for car standards at time t–1 (`cc_pol_car_lag`)\n",
    "   - Support for carbon taxes at time t–1 (`cc_pol_tax_lag`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first equation, both lagged predictors are statistically significant. Prior support for carbon taxes predicts current support (β = 0.4714, p < 0.01), indicating a strong self-reinforcing dynamic. In addition, prior support for emissions standards also significantly predicts current carbon tax support (β = 0.2570, p < 0.01). The model explains 42.8% of the variation in current support for carbon taxes (R² = 0.4282).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second equation, past support for emissions standards strongly predicts current support (β = 0.5362, p < 0.01), and past support for carbon taxes also has a positive, statistically significant effect (β = 0.1933, p < 0.01). The model explains 45.9% of the variation in emissions standards support (R² = 0.4592).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "These results indicate that both policy attitudes are temporally stable and mutually reinforcing. Public support for carbon taxes and emissions standards not only persists over time but also positively influences each other. This dynamic suggests that once support for one policy begins to shift, it may contribute to broader shifts in public support for related climate policy instruments."

    "The Panel VAR results reveal a **mutually reinforcing relationship** between willingness to pay, climate policy support, and community-level climate concern. While WTP itself exhibits only modest temporal stability, it is significantly driven by prior concern and policy support. Conversely, support for carbon taxes is highly stable and dynamically influenced by both WTP and harm perception. These findings suggest that election-period dynamics in WTP are embedded within broader patterns of **interdependent climate attitudes**, rather than occurring as sharp exogenous shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the model does not include a direct indicator of policy cost or election period, the results suggest that **individuals' financial commitment to climate action is shaped by prior beliefs and policy support, rather than by election-period fluctuations alone**. Future models may explore low-cost vs high-cost scenarios or include election-wave interactions explicitly."

    "### Panel VAR Analysis – RQ4 (Subgrouped by Political Ideology)\n",
    "To assess whether political ideology moderates the relationship between climate harm perception and willingness to pay (WTP) for climate solutions, I estimated separate Panel VAR(1) models for conservative and liberal participants. The key dependent variable was `ccSolve` (willingness to pay), with lagged predictors including `ccSolve_lag` and `cc4_comm_lag` (perceived harm to local communities).\n",
    "\n",
    "Models were estimated using pooled OLS with standard errors clustered at the individual level (`PID`).\n",

    "| Predictor       | Coefficient | Significance    |\n",
    "|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| `cc4_comm_lag`  | **0.129**   | *** p < 0.01    |\n",

    "\n",
    "→ Among conservatives, **perceived harm to the local community at t–1 significantly increases willingness to pay at time t**. This suggests that harm perception is a strong predictor of climate-related financial support in this subgroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Liberal Participants (pol_ideology = 4–5)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Predictor       | Coefficient | Significance |\n",

    "| R-squared       | 0.022       | —            |\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Among liberals, **willingness to pay is primarily predicted by its own past value**, with **no significant contribution from perceived harm**. This suggests that liberals’ willingness to pay is more stable and less influenced by short-term shifts in perceived community-level harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "These findings provide evidence that **political ideology moderates the relationship between harm perception and willingness to pay**. Among conservatives, harm perception plays a **significant causal role** in increasing willingness to pay for climate solutions, whereas among liberals, WTP appears **less sensitive to harm perception** and more **internally consistent over time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is consistent with theoretical expectations: liberals may hold a more **ideologically grounded** climate position, whereas conservative support may depend more on **issue salience** or **personal/community relevance**."
