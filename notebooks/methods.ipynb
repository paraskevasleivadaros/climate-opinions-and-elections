Since no single policy was designated as the primary focus of the analysis, both are examined in parallel to assess how support for climate policies evolves over time and how it is shaped by related attitudes such as perceived harm, willingness to pay, and political identity. This approach ensures that findings are not limited to one specific policy type, but reflect broader patterns in climate policy support. Below we will explore the support for emissions standards"

    "To explore the dynamic relationship between perceived climate change harm and support for climate policy, I estimated a Panel VAR(1) model including three variables:\n",
    "- `cc_pol_tax`: support for a carbon tax  \n",
    "- `cc4_comm`: perceived harm from climate change to one's local community  \n",
    "- `cc4_famheal`: perceived harm to one’s family’s health\n",

    "This Panel VAR model shows that both **community-level and personal-level climate harm perceptions** are dynamically linked with **policy support**. Community-level harm perception appears particularly influential in predicting **future support for carbon taxes**. At the same time, **policy support also contributes to increased harm perception**, suggesting a reciprocal dynamic.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings are consistent with theoretical models of climate opinion formation, where perceptions and policy preferences evolve together. Notably, while both forms of perceived harm are internally stable, **community-level concern appears more strongly connected to policy attitudes** than personal-level concern."

    "### Panel VAR Analysis – RQ4 (Subgrouped by Political Ideology)\n",
    "To assess whether political ideology moderates the relationship between climate harm perception and willingness to pay (WTP) for climate solutions, I estimated separate Panel VAR(1) models for conservative and liberal participants. The key dependent variable was `ccSolve` (willingness to pay), with lagged predictors including `ccSolve_lag` and `cc4_comm_lag` (perceived harm to local communities).\n",
    "\n",
    "Models were estimated using pooled OLS with standard errors clustered at the individual level (`PID`).\n",

    "### Results\n",
    "#### Conservative Participants (pol_ideology = 1–2)\n",
    "| Predictor       | Coefficient | Significance    |\n",
    "|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| `cc4_comm_lag`  | **0.129**   | *** p < 0.01    |\n",

    "\n",
    "→ Among conservatives, **perceived harm to the local community at t–1 significantly increases willingness to pay at time t**. This suggests that harm perception is a strong predictor of climate-related financial support in this subgroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Liberal Participants (pol_ideology = 4–5)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Predictor       | Coefficient | Significance |\n",
    "|-----------------|-------------|--------------|\n",
    "| `cc4_comm_lag`  | 0.003       | Not significant |\n",
    "| `ccSolve_lag`   | **0.154**   | ** p < 0.01 |\n",
    "| R-squared       | 0.022       | —            |\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Among liberals, **willingness to pay is primarily predicted by its own past value**, with **no significant contribution from perceived harm**. This suggests that liberals’ willingness to pay is more stable and less influenced by short-term shifts in perceived community-level harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "These findings provide evidence that **political ideology moderates the relationship between harm perception and willingness to pay**. Among conservatives, harm perception plays a **significant causal role** in increasing willingness to pay for climate solutions, whereas among liberals, WTP appears **less sensitive to harm perception** and more **internally consistent over time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is consistent with theoretical expectations: liberals may hold a more **ideologically grounded** climate position, whereas conservative support may depend more on **issue salience** or **personal/community relevance**."
