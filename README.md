# climate-opinions-shift-elections-policies
How much do people's attitudes toward climate change and climate related policies shift during an election?

### Relevance of research question
My research question is highly relevant as it explores the relationship between political events, policies, and society's attitudes toward climate change. Climate change is one of the most important global challenges at the moment. For this reason, understanding how elections and policies shape public opinion is crucial. This knowledge is important for policymakers and researchers working to connect political decisions with public involvement in tackling climate change.

### Causal Discovery or Causal Inference?
In this research report I will be using causal inference, as my primary interest lies in understanding the effect of specific factors (elections and policies) on people's attitudes toward climate change.

### Why Causal Inference?
- **Known causal structure:** My research already hypothesizes relationships; elections and policies influence attitudes toward climate change. I am not trying to discover the causal graph from scratch.
- **Quantifying effects:** I want to measure how much (e.g., the magnitude of the shift in attitudes) and in what way (e.g., positive or negative) elections and policies influence attitudes.

### Sub-Questions
I am focusing on causal inference which is most suited to sub-questions that aim to **quantify causal effects** or determine the **mechanisms** through which certain variables (e.g., elections, policies) influence others (e.g., attitudes toward climate change). Here's a breakdown of the sub-questions:

1. **Election Timing and Attitudes**
  - How do people's attitudes toward climate change change in the months leading up to an election?
    - Causal Inference Role: Quantify the causal effect of the election campaign period on attitudes by comparing pre-election and election-period data.
    - Methods: Difference-in-Differences (DiD), time-series analysis
  - What differences, if any, are observed in attitudes immediately after an election compared to before?
    - Causal Inference Role: Measure the causal impact of the election outcome on attitudes
    - Methods: Regression discontinuity design (if election results are close), DiD
  - Do shifts in attitudes differ depending on the election's outcome (e.g., political party or candidate elected)?
    - Causal Inference Role: Examine the effect of different political outcomes on public attitudes
    - Methods: Instrumental variables (e.g., close elections as instruments), stratified analyses
2. **Role of Policies**
  - How do climate change policies announced during the election campaign affect public attitudes toward climate change?
    - Causal Inference Role: Evaluate the causal effect of policy announcements on attitudes
    - Methods: Propensity score matching, DiD (pre- and post-policy announcement)
  - Are policies introduced after an election perceived differently in shaping public opinion compared to those introduced before?
    - Causal Inference Role: Compare the causal impact of timing (pre- vs. post-election) on public attitudes
    - Methods: Mediation analysis, DiD
3. **Contextual and Demographic Factors**
  - How do demographic factors (e.g., age, education, political affiliation) influence shifts in attitudes toward climate change before and after an election?
    - Causal Inference Role: Investigate heterogeneous treatment effects (how causal effects vary by subgroup)
    - Methods: Subgroup analysis in causal inference models, propensity score stratification
  - Do regional or national differences in climate policy frameworks affect how attitudes shift during election periods?
    - Causal Inference Role: Explore causal effects across different contexts (e.g., regions, policy environments)
    - Methods: Multi-level models, stratified analysis
